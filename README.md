Homework MVC: Index

1. Extend the app we've built in class so that the index route uses EJS to render all the fruits into HTML
    - Each fruit that is displayed should have a link to that fruit's show page
    - Each fruit's show page should have a link back to the index page
1. Clone this repo [this starter code](https://git.generalassemb.ly/WebDev-Connected-Classroom/space-Hw) and follow the directions in the comments in ```server.js```. This is the server code you have to fit in the rest
